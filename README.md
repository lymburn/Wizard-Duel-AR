Wizard Duel AR is a simple AR game with the goal of dodging or intercepting enemy spells with your own spell. It primarily uses SceneKit and ARKit 
to create 3D models and spell projectiles. It also uses elements of UIKit for game images and labels as well as UserDefaults for score persistence.
I made this game as a way for me to practice using different iOS frameworks and work with new technologies such as 3D graphics.  

Key Features:  
• Realistic physics projectiles with particle effects  
• Projectiles spawn at random distances and fire towards the camera orientation  
• Basic animation of 3D models  
• Current and high score counter with basic persistence  
• Sound and music effects  

Skills Practiced:    
• Learned the basics of SceneKit and ARKit  
• Practiced reading official documentation as SceneKit had little support compared to Unity  
• Learned how to import and animate 3D models in SceneKit  
• Practiced audio playback with AVFoundation
